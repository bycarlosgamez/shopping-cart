# My Awesome Project

Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS (skeleton boilerplate) & JavaScript

Made a simple landing page using vanilla HTML & CSS, just used the skeleton (http://getskeleton.com/) boilerplate to start and build from there, added some functionality with vanilla JS to add, remove, and clear items from the cart.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

In the future, the plan is to add a backend functionality and a database of products using MongoDB.

## Lessons Learned:

On this project, I learned about instesectionObservers in javascript to trigger a response to use instead of scroll.
